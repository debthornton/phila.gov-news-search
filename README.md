The phila.gov api is called on page load.

To search for an article by title, type a keyword into the searchbox and click the 'Search' button or hit 'Enter' on the keyboard.

This website makes a simple API call to phila.gov and displays articles from a batch of 20 returned results.

A new li element with the article's title, date, and a link to the article is created upon the completion of the API call.
